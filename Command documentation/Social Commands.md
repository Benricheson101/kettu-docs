Social commands are commands that interact with other users such as boops, hugs, bapping and more. If you do not want people to use social commands on you, you can disable this using the preference command `/preference commandHere`. For example, if you do not want other people to kiss you run the command `/preference kiss` and any time someone try's to kiss you an error message will will stop the command from running as shown below.
