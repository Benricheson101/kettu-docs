# Voting

Voting is a simple way to help Kettu out. You can find all the sites you can vote for using the `/vote` command. When you vote for Kettu you gain vote points. 1 for sites that you can vote for every 12 hours and 2 for sites that you can vote for every 24 hours. Once you have 200 vote points you will be automatically be given a voter badge in your Kettu profile as our thanks to you for voting for Kettu.

You can be reminded to vote by running the commands `/togglevote`. When it is time to vote a DM reminder will be sent.

NOTE that some of these sites may not always send us the data when you vote (especially topgg).
